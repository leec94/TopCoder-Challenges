# TopCoder-Challenges
A collection of solutions to TopCoder Challenges 

Note: 
TopCoder creates an object of your class and runs the method mentioned in the problem statement. This is why the method has to be public. It passes different arguments to the method and checks the return value of the method with expected return value. DONT print out the answer in Topcoder, it doesnâ€™t help you any ( except maybe for debugging ) (from https://thevc.wordpress.com/2008/02/27/getting-started-on-topcoder/)
